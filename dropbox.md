Dropbox was a service to upload a directory into the cloud and share files and
directories with whoever you want. Now they also have a real time editing tool
that includes a lot of features to add other type of media like videos, sounds,
etc. including the basic commenting system. This probably built on top of
the [hackpad](https://hackpad.com/),
[service that they acquired 3 years ago](https://hackpad.com/Hackpad-is-teaming-up-with-Dropbox-m1Fne5A6Lzn) 
and now you can [import to DropboxPaper](https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/9156).
